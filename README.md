# Population in Yucatán : Women and Men Analysis for each municipality
In this analysis the code analyse the Yucatan population and how this sector is divided between men and women, comparing the differences and the behavior in 2010 to provide


In the 2010 census for Yucatán, the total population was approximately 1.96 million, with a slight female majority (50.7% women vs. 49.3% men), a trend that intensified in Mérida (51.2% women in 2020) due to urban migration, while Ticul and Progreso show balance or male majority (50.5% and 51.2% men, respectively) owing to rural and coastal economies. In occupation, men account for 60-70% of the employed (78.5% male participation rate in 2020), with women facing 1.5-2 times higher unemployment (4.1% vs. 2.5%) and elevated sub-occupation due to caregiving roles; household headship is predominantly male (75-85%), with only 22-30% female, reflecting patriarchal structures that limit female empowerment in municipalities like Ticul (82% male).
This dynamic is mirrored across the Yucatán Peninsula (Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Campeche), with 5.1 million inhabitants in 2020 and women at 51%, yet female labor participation at only 45-46% (gap of 28.8 percentage points in 2025) and headship at 24%, exacerbated by tourism in Quintana Roo (women 55% in services but 60% informal).

The hypothesis is that, based on 2010 census data for Yucatán, the persistent gender gaps in occupation and household headship—where men dominate employment (60-70%) and headship (75-85%), while women face higher unemployment (1.5-2 times greater) and limited empowerment—perpetuate regional inequalities, potentially reducing economic productivity by 10-15% due to underutilized female potential. This effect likely varies by location, with urban areas like Mérida showing greater female participation (though still constrained) and rural zones like Ticul exhibiting stronger patriarchal structures, suggesting that policy interventions, such as localized childcare support, must be tailored to specific municipal contexts to effectively address these disparities.
